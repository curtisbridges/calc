# Calculator

This project exists simply to exercise my web development skills.

Background:
1. This is my own work, not a tutorial.
2. This is 100% my own code, no copy and paste from other sources.
3. I used a target design (iOS calculator, see below) and modified where I thought I could improve the design.
4. This project is an example React app.
5. React Hooks used include: `useContext`, `useState`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useReducer` as well as a custom hook.
6. Both a link CSS stylesheet (global) and CSS (local) modules are used for styling.
7. This project uses Jest for unit tests.
