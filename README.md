# Calculator

This project exists simply to exercise my web development skills.

Background:
1. This is my own work, not a tutorial.
2. This is 100% my own code, no copy and paste from other sources.
3. I used a target design (iOS calculator, see below) and modified where I thought I could improve the design.

[See the deployed version.](https://calc.curtisbridges.com/)
